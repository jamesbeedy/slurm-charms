  Slurmctld, the central management daemon of Slurm.
description: |
  This charm provides slurmctld, munged, and the bindings to other utilities
  that make lifecycle operations a breeze.

  slurmctld is the central management daemon of SLURM. It monitors all other
  SLURM daemons and resources, accepts work (jobs), and allocates resources
  to those jobs.  Given the critical functionality of slurmctld, there may be
  a backup server to assume these functions in the event that the primary
  server fails.

      description: |
        Name to be recorded in database for jobs from this cluster.

        This is important if a single database is used to record information from
        multiple Slurm-managed clusters.

      type: boolean
      default: True
      description: |
        Install prometheus-slurm-exporter from (ubuntu-hpc)
        [https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-hpc/+archive/ubuntu/prometheus-slurm-exporter]  using apt-get.

    user-provided-slurm-path-prefix:
      type: string
      default: ""
      description: |
        Path prefix to the user provided slurm build. Setting this value
        will cause the charm to configure systemd services to point to the
        executables inside of the prefix path to use slurm and munge at the provided
        location instead of installing to the filesystem using apt-get.

        Example:
          Given the slurm and munge libs, daemons, and executables live at
          /srv/slurm/view/{bin,sbin,usr,lib,include}, we would configure this option
          to point to /srv/slurm/view.

          $ juju config slurmctld user-provided-slurm-path-prefix=/srv/slurm/view

    default-partition:
      type: string
      default: ""
      description: |
        Default Slurm partition. This is only used if defined, and must match an

      description: |

      default: ""
      type: string
      description: |
        Extra parameters for NHC command.

        This option can be used to customize how NHC is called, e.g. to send an
        e-mail to an admin when NHC detects an error set this value to.
        `-M admin@domain.com`.

    health-check-interval:
      default: 600

      description: Interval in seconds between executions of the Health Check.

    health-check-state:

      description: Only run the Health Check on nodes in this state.

actions:
  show-current-config:

    required:

      Note: Newly added nodes will remain in the `down` state until configured,
